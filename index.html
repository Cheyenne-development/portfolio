<h1>Hello, I'm Cheyenne McMahon</h1>
<p>I'm a software developer living in Madison, WI</p>
<p>Until recently I was employeed in the printing industry. I was one of the people responsible for you recieving so much junk mail. Sorry about that. As a developer I'm interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating quality websites people want to vist</li>
<li>Working in technology and having a career I love</li>
<li>Working with like minded people</li>
</ul>

<!--- About me -->

<article id="about">
<h2 class="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>Until the pandemic I'd spent 15 years years working in the printing industry. Now because of the pandemic and thanks to <a href="http://thinkful.com"> Thinkful</a> I'm looking to find a new path.</p>
<p>I've always been interested in web development. I never really had a chance to try my hand at until everything went totally pear-shaped. Now that the oppurtunity has presented itself I'm hoping to learn as much as I can and to be able to work with as many people as possible.</p>
<p>Beyond web development my passions include technology and science, space in particular. There have been numerous times I'd look something up on wikipedia and I'd fall through the rabbit hole and would end up reading articles on stellar nucleosynsthesis and pair instability supernovas. I possess a great deal of curiosity and a desire to continually learn new things.</p>
