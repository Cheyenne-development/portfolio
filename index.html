<h1>Hello, I'm Cheyenne McMahon</h1>
<p>I'm a software developer living in Madison, WI</p>
<p>Until recently I was employeed in the printing industry. I was one of the people responsible for you recieving so much junk mail. Sorry about that. As a developer I'm interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating quality websites people want to vist</li>
<li>Working in technology and having a career I love</li>
<li>Working with like minded people</li>
</ul>

  <div class="about">
    <div class="item">
    <p>Until the pandemic I'd spent 15 years years working in the printing industry. Now because of the pandemic and thanks to <a href="http://thinkful.com"> Thinkful</a> I'm looking to find a new path.</p>
<p>I've always been interested in web development. I never really had a chance to try my hand at until everything went totally pear-shaped. Now that the oppurtunity has presented itself I'm hoping to learn as much as I can and to be able to work with as many people as possible.</p>
<p>Beyond web development my passions include technology and science, space in particular. This picture here is of Eta Carinae in the Homunculus Nebula. Provided an oppurtunity to journey in to space I would. There have been numerous times I'd look something up on wikipedia and I'd fall through the rabbit hole and would end up reading articles on stellar nucleosynsthesis and pair instability supernovas. I possess a great deal of curiosity and a desire to continually learn new things.</p> 
<p>I'm looking to make my way into to the world of full-stack web devfelopment. This is merely a start and will improve greatly from here.</p>

        <h3>Placeholder</h3>
        <img src="images/cute_kittens.jpg" alt="Surprised Kitten">
        <p>It's Placeholder. What does it do? Well it holds a place until something real is created. Until then here's a kitten picture, enjoy.</p>

         <p>It's the Ultra Deluxe combination of Thingdoer and Placeholder. What does that mean? Well it holds a place and does a thing. Here's a picture of some kittens for the meantime.</p>
